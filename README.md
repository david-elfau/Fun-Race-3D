# Fun Race 3D fast version

## Time spend on it.
5h 

## Most difficult parts
Create a camera system without help of cinemachine cameras.

## The parts I think I could do better and how:
Camera swap: I would create a better transition and go back to the original position
Spacing between chasing obstacle: There is a small window to enter into a burst. With more space between obstacles could be fixed

## I would do if I could go a step further on this game
- It could create better obstacles and more variety with more time.
- I would add different movement, not only linear, waiting times between nodes
- I would improve the cameras, to add more transitions
- I would improve the feedback provided to the player. 
  - I would add particles on the ending.
  - I would add waiting times between respawn
  - I would add particles on collision
- I would improve the UI adding progression and better text messages

 ## Comments
- I enjoyed a lot doing this test. 
- I think it can help to understand a prototype even it is far to be final quality
